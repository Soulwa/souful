# souful

soulful is a rhythm game where you can make your own beatmaps and play them yourself, or send them to others to play

how to play:
- install the latest version of the game from the releases section
- when you run the game, you can load a song from anywhere on your computer to make a new beatmap, or play an existing beatmap
  - the existing beatmap **must be loaded** from soulful_Data/beatmaps- any you make will automatically go there
  - audio must be in the .wav/.ogg format- I recommend using youtube-dl to get any music you want to use, with the command line args -x --audio-format wav
- beatmaps are automatically zipped up when you finish making them, with the song you chose and the necessary data for the game to replay
